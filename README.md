# Lilac Modules for VCV Rack

## Accumulator

A signal of N volts on the RATE input will accumulate on the SUM output by N
volts per second. For example, a constant input of 1V will accumulate to 10V
over 10 seconds.

A trigger on the RESET input will reset the sum to zero.

## Comparator

Compares two input voltages A and B.

## Looper

See separate [Lilac Loop](https://github.com/grough/lilac-loop-vcv) plugin.
